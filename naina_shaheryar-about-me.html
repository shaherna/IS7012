	 Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
	 In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance,
	 useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption,
	 for use as dyes, or for medicinal or cosmetic use.

Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread, but many other types of foods can be baked.[1] Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and pieces of bread to their center. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center".[2] Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other.
 Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
